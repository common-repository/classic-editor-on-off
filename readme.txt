Description: Classic Editor on off is a plugin that gives the ability to turn off all or some of Gutenberg, reverting to classic editor - where needed. Gutenberg (Gutenberg Blocks / Gutenberg Editor) replaced the Classic Editor but there may be times you wish to use the classic editor. Disable Gutenberg Blocks completely, or choose to disable for widgets, posts or pages.

If you prefer the old editors or just need to do some testing, this plugin will assist you in reverting to non Gutenberg setups by replacing with the Classic Editor.

Use this plugin to restores original Edit Post screen / Widgets screen (TinyMCE, meta boxes, etc.).

For temporary changes or disable permanently: Widgets, posts or pages - you choose!
